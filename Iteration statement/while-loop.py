# A while loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code 
# as long as a given condition is true.

# Example of a while loop:
count = 0

while count < 5:  # Loop will run as long as count is less than 5
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1  # Increment count to avoid infinite loop

#output:
# Count is: 0
# Count is: 1
# Count is: 2
# Count is: 3  
# Count is: 4
