# A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or a range of numbers.

# Example: Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Example: Iterating over a range of numbers
for i in range(5):  # range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4
    print(i)
